# QazByEx
Android educational app to help people learn Qazaq language. Finished and published on PlayMarket: http://bit.ly/2wJvL68. 

### Getting Started

Depending on your motives:
- You will need Android Studio to run the code and test it for bugs/efficiency. Additionally, make sure you have an Android phone and an Emulator to test how the program works.
- You may simply download the app and see how it works on your phone.
